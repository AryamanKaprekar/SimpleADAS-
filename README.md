# SimpleADAS-
The SmartRover is a cloud-controlled vehicle with obstacle detection capabilities. Its inspiration comes from the Advanced Driving Assistant Systems (ADAS) which has one of the functions being automatic brake on close proximity to obstacles. This Project is just a simple integration of two concepts, Internet Controlled Vehicle and ADAS. The HTML code for the webpage/app and Arduino code is given in this directory.
